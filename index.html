<p> <font face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF">It's time to PARTY! MINECON Earth parties are a fantastic way to enjoy the biggest Minecraft event of the year with friends,
family and other players, all over the world! Use our interactive list to find the nearest MINECON Earth party to you.</p>

<p> <font face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"> MINECON Earth doesn't end with the livestream! Check out our YouTube channel after the broadcast to watch panels with Minecraft
experts. Panellists will be discussing making a map with MCEdit, creating and maintaining an SMP, breaking Minecraft (hey,
don't do that!) and modded Minecraft!</p>

<p> <font face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"> A Minecrafter from the very early days, it’s an absolute mega-honour to have Martyn Littlewood join us on the MINECON Earth
stage! Let’s get to know him better via the medium of Q&A...</p>

<p> <font face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"> Teleporters. (They'd come as a set of two.) Using nether portals is okay but I'd love a single block platform you could step
on to and have it teleport you to its partner in other parts of your world. You could set up homes away from home or a make
a fast travel back to a stronghold or mineshaft! Just imagine a cool room in your base lined up with teleporters all signposted!
:D</p>
